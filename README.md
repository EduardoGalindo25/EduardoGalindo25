# Hi, I'm Eduardo 👋

I'm a passionate **Full Stack developer** with a love for coding and continuous learning.  
I primarily work with **PHP**, but I also enjoy exploring **web and mobile development** using modern technologies.

---

## 💻 What I Do

- Build **web and mobile applications** using PHP, Laravel, React, React Native, and JavaScript.  
- Experienced with **databases**: MySQL, SQL Server.  
- Manage **servers and tools**: Linux, Apache, Git, GitHub, Composer, Postman, CLI, FTP.  
- Work with **Node.js (Express)**, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Java, C# and automation with **GitHub Actions**.  
- Apply security best practices and **cybersecurity concepts** in development.

---

## 📦 Libraries and Repositories

I don’t have a “main project” yet, but I **publish PHP libraries and open-source tools** for the community.  
My future goal is to create a **lightweight microframework** for PHP that’s accessible and easy to use.
